# Ecommerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building and analyzing an e-commerce database using SQL. The project includes creating a database, defining tables, establishing relationships, and performing various data analysis tasks, including time series analysis. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data related to orders, payments, shipments, and customer interactions.

## Project Structure

- **Database Design**: 
  - **Tables**: `payments`, `shipments`, `orders`, `customers`, `products`, `orderDetail`, `vendors`, `categories`.
  - **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints between tables to ensure data integrity.

- **SQL Queries**: 
  - Basic CRUD operations.
  - Advanced queries using sub-queries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, aggregate functions, and CASE/WHEN statements.
  - Time series analysis focusing on trends in payments, shipments, and orders over different time intervals.

## Features

- **Database Creation**:
  - Script for creating tables and establishing relationships.
  - Sample data insertion for realistic analysis.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Queries for analyzing sales trends, payment patterns, customer behavior, and shipment efficiency.
  - Time series analysis for identifying trends and anomalies in the dataset.
